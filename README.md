# Bikesharing prediction

In this project, a neural network is built from scratch to carry out a prediction problem on a real dataset! By building a neural network from the ground up, we will have a much better understanding of gradient descent, backpropagation, and other concepts that are important to know before we move to higher level tools such as PyTorch. We'll also get to see how to apply these networks to solve real prediction problems!
